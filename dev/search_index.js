One is that it assumes A uses one-based indexing, which would fail in cases like OffsetArrays and FFTViews. Another issue is that it requires indexing, while not all array types support indexing (for example, CuArrays).

Such traits should be declared and used when appropriate. For example, if a line of code requires mutation, the trait ArrayInterface.ismutable(A) should be checked before attempting to mutate, and informative error messages should be written to capture the immutable case (or, an alternative code which does not mutate should be given).\n\nOne example of this principle is demonstrated in the generation of Jacobian matrices. In many scientific applications, one may wish to generate a Jacobian cache from the user's input u0. A naive way to generate this Jacobian is J = similar(u0,length(u0),length(u0)).

However, a macro like @muladd is trivial to picture on a code (it recursively transforms a*b + c to muladd(a,b,c) for more accuracy and efficiency), so using such a macro for example:\n\njulia> @macroexpand(@muladd k3 = f(t + c3 * dt, @. uprev + dt * (a031 * k1 + a032 * k2)))\n:(k3 = f((muladd)(c3, dt, t), (muladd).(dt, (muladd).(a032, k2, (*).(a031, k1)), uprev)))\n\nis recommended. Some macros in this category are:\n\n@inbounds\n@muladd\n@view\n@named\n@.\n@..\n\nSome performance macros, like @simd, @threads, or @turbo from LoopVectorization.jl, make an exception in that their generated code may be foreign to many users.

For example, one can hit all the code with Array, but that does not test whether CuArray is compatible! Thus, it's always good to think of coverage not in terms of lines of code but in terms of type coverage. A good list of number types to think about are:\n\nFloat64\nFloat32\nComplex\nDual\nBigFloat\n\nArray types to think about testing are:\n\nArray\nOffsetArray\nCuArray","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/style/#When-in-doubt,-a-submodule-should-become-a-subpackage-or-separate-package","page":"Style Guide","title":"When in doubt, a submodule should become a subpackage or separate package","text":"Keep packages to one core idea.

A similar argument applies to reading code with closures; if someone is looking for type instabilities, this is faster to do when code does not contain closures. Furthermore, if you want to update variables in an outer scope, do so explicitly with Refs or self defined structs. For example,\n\nmap(Base.Fix2(getindex, i), vector_of_vectors)\n\nis preferred over\n\nmap(v -> v[i], vector_of_vectors)\n\nor\n\n[v[i] for v in vector_of_vectors]","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/style/#Numerical-functionality-should-use-the-appropriate-generic-numerical-interfaces","page":"Style Guide","title":"Numerical functionality should use the appropriate generic numerical interfaces","text":"While you can use A\\b to do a linear solve inside a package, that does not mean that you should.
